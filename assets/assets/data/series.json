      "videoIntro": "The Walking Dead is adapted from the comic book of the same name by Tony Moore. It is the first authentic zombie TV series in the history of television. The town sheriff Rick Grimes was shot during an operation. When he woke up from a coma, he found that the town was gloomy and full of dead bodies. What's more terrifying is that some dead bodies wandered the streets and alleys, bloodthirsty and had already turned into terrifying zombies. A surviving father and son learned that a large number of survivors had already evacuated to the shelter in Atlanta. In order to find his missing wife and children, Rick went on the road alone. However, Atlanta had already fallen into a dead city, and zombies had an absolute dominant position here. Rick, who was besieged by zombies, was rescued by several survivors. After a hard fight, they finally returned to the camp in the wild.\n\nAfter learning from the CDC that there was no antidote to save them, Rick decided to lead the survivors to escape from Atlanta to Fort Benning Military Base in the hope of getting help from the surviving army. On the interstate highway, a large car jam forced them to stop moving forward. The zombies came out to look for food. Rick and his group fled in panic. Sophia disappeared in the panic to avoid the zombies, and everyone had to search separately. While looking for Sophia's whereabouts, Carl was shot by a hunter Otis when he hunted a deer. Otis told them that the Green Farm where they lived could treat Carl, and the survivors entered the remaining paradise in this chaotic world.",
